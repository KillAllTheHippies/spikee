# Spikee GUI Implementation Plan (Tkinter)

This document outlines the plan for implementing a Tkinter-based GUI for the Spikee project.

**Note:** This plan prioritizes building the GUI on top of the existing codebase without substantial alterations to the existing files.

## 1. Project Setup and File Structure

- Create a new directory `spikee_gui` within the `spikee` directory.
- Inside `spikee_gui`, create the following files:
    - `main.py`: The main entry point for the GUI application.
    - `menu.py`: Handles the creation and logic of the menu bar.
    - `modes.py`: Manages the different modes and their associated functionality.
    - `gui.py`: Contains the main GUI layout and widgets (excluding the menu, which is in `menu.py`).

## 2. `main.py` (Entry Point)

- Import necessary modules from Tkinter, `menu.py`, `modes.py`, and `gui.py`.
- Initialize the main Tkinter window (`root`).
- Set the window title (e.g., "Spikee GUI").
- Create an instance of the menu bar (from `menu.py`).
- Create an instance of the main GUI layout (from `gui.py`).
- Start the Tkinter event loop (`root.mainloop()`).

## 3. `menu.py` (Menu Bar)

- Define a class for the menu bar (e.g., `MenuBar`).
- In the constructor:
    - Create a `tk.Menu` widget.
    - Create submenus (File, Edit, Modes, Help, etc.).
    - Add commands to each submenu.
        - "File" menu: "Exit" (closes the application).
        - "Modes" menu: Dynamically populate this with available modes (read from `modes.py`). Each mode should have a command associated with it to switch to that mode.
        - "Help" menu: "About" (displays information about the application).
- Implement command handlers for menu items (e.g., `exit_app`, `switch_to_mode`).

## 4. `modes.py` (Mode Management)

- Define a class or dictionary to represent a mode (e.g., `Mode` class or `MODES` dictionary). Each mode should have:
    - A unique identifier (name or slug).
    - A display name.
    - A description (optional).
    - A function or class to call when the mode is activated.
- Create a function `get_available_modes()` that returns a list of all available modes.
- Create a function `switch_mode(mode_id)` that handles switching between modes. This function should:
    - Deactivate the current mode (if any).
    - Activate the new mode (call the associated function or create an instance of the associated class).
    - Update the GUI to reflect the new mode (e.g., change the displayed widgets).

## 5. `gui.py` (GUI Layout)

- Define a class for the main GUI layout (e.g., `MainGUI`).
- In the constructor:
    - Create the main frame that will hold the content for each mode.
    - Initially, display a default view (e.g., a welcome message or instructions).
- Create methods to update the GUI based on the active mode:
    - `set_mode_view(mode_view)`: Clears the current content and displays the view associated with the selected mode.

## 6. Integration and Dynamic Mode Loading

- In `menu.py`, the "Modes" submenu should be populated dynamically using the `get_available_modes()` function from `modes.py`.
- When a mode is selected from the menu, the `switch_mode()` function in `modes.py` should be called.
- `switch_mode()` should then call `set_mode_view()` in `gui.py` to update the GUI.

## 7. Functionality Integration

- The existing functionality of `spikee` (from `cli.py`, `generator.py`, etc.) needs to be integrated into the GUI. This can be done in several ways:
    - **Direct Calls:** If the functionality is exposed as functions, the GUI can directly call these functions. This is the preferred method given the constraint of minimal changes to existing files.
    - **Subprocesses:** For command-line tools or functionality not easily accessible as functions, the GUI can use the `subprocess` module to run them. This allows using existing CLI commands without modification.
    - **Refactoring:** While refactoring is generally beneficial for code reuse, it's minimized in this plan to avoid substantial alterations to existing files. Refactoring should only be considered if direct calls or subprocesses are not feasible.

## 8. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling throughout the GUI.
- Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., using `tk.messagebox`).

## 9. Testing

- Thoroughly test the GUI to ensure all menu items and mode switching work correctly.
- Test the integration with the existing `spikee` functionality.

## 10. Testing

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of the GUI. The following types of tests should be implemented:

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test individual functions and classes in isolation.
    - Located in the `spikee_gui` directory, alongside the code they are testing (e.g., `test_menu.py`, `test_modes.py`, `test_gui.py`).
    - Use the `unittest` module or a testing framework like `pytest`.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the interaction between different modules (e.g., `menu.py` and `modes.py`).
    - Located in a separate `tests` directory within `spikee_gui`.
    - Use the `unittest` module or `pytest`.
- **UI Tests:**
    - Test the GUI as a whole, simulating user interactions.
    - Use a testing library like `tkinter.ttk.test` or a dedicated UI testing framework.
    - Located in the `tests` directory.
    - These tests should cover:
        - Menu item functionality.
        - Mode switching.
        - Input validation.
        - Error handling.
        - Visual layout and appearance.

## 11. Configuration Profiles

- The GUI will support configuration profiles to allow users to quickly switch between different settings.
- Profiles will be stored in `spikee_gui/config/profiles.json`.
- The following profiles will be created:
  - **default:** Sensible default settings for general use.
  - **quick_test:** Settings for running a quick test.
  - **full_analysis:** Settings for running a comprehensive analysis.
- The `profiles.json` file will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "description": "Default profile with sensible settings for general use.",
    "list": {
      "default_list_type": "Targets"
    },
    "generate": {
      "default_target": null,
      "default_plugin": null,
      "parameters": {}
    },
    "test": {
      "default_options": {}
    }
  },
  "quick_test": {
    "description": "Settings for running a quick test.",
     "list": {
      "default_list_type": "Targets"
    },
    "generate": {
      "default_target": null,
      "default_plugin": null,
      "parameters": {}
    },
    "test": {
      "default_options": {"fast_mode": true}
    }
  },
    "full_analysis": {
    "description": "Settings for a comprehensive analysis.",
     "list": {
      "default_list_type": "Targets"
    },
    "generate": {
      "default_target": null,
      "default_plugin": null,
      "parameters": {}
    },
    "test": {
      "default_options": {"all_tests": true, "detailed_report": true}
    }
  }
}
```
- The GUI will load the "default" profile on startup.
- Users will be able to select a different profile from a dropdown in the menu bar (likely in the "File" or "Edit" menu).

## 12. Refinement and Iteration

- Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.
